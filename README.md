# ecommerce-api
This is the mock API for my simple [ecommerce project](https://github.com/kenjinakagava/ecommerce).

It only has six entries and when called returns the following values:

- id 
- title
- cover
- shortDescription
- description
- price
- paymentLink
- featured

You need to go to /albums.json to see the data.
